    default Rails tmp folder.
- Allow configuring the tmp directory where the error log gets written into,
    with the `tmp_path` configuration setting.
- Support for ActiveRecord 4.0. Adds the following migration methods:
  - #rename_index, #change_column_null, #add_reference, #remove_reference,
    #set_field_encoding, #add_timestamps, #remove_timestamps, #rename_table,
    #rename_column

## [0.1.0.rc.7] - 2016-09-15

### Added

### Added

- Support non-ddl migrations by implementing the methods for the ActiveRecord
    quering to work.

    other adapters.

## [0.1.0.rc.5] - 2016-03-29

    being missing.

### Added

- Support #drop_table
- Support for foreing keys in db/schema.rb when using [Foreigner
gem](https://github.com/matthuhiggins/foreigner) in Rails 3 apps. This allows to
define foreign keys with #execute, but does not provide support for
add_foreign_key yet.

## [0.1.0.rc.3] - 2016-03-10

### Added

- Support #execute. Allows to execute raw SQL from the migration
